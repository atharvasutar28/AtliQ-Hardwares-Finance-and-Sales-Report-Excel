# AtliQ-Hardwares-Finance-and-Sales-Report-Excel
# Project Overview
I created a Finance and Sales Report using Excel for a company in the Electronics domain. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of sales trends, net revenue, and profit margins over several fiscal periods, broken down by months, quarters, and regions. It incorporates key financial metrics and performance comparisons pre- and during-COVID, offering a clear picture of how the business was impacted by the pandemic. The report also includes an in-depth analysis of product performance and customer demand, helping stakeholders identify areas of growth and opportunities for optimizing sales strategies.

With advanced data manipulation tools like Power Pivot, I analyzed 100K+ rows of sales data, generating valuable insights to inform decision-making and improve future forecasting. The report streamlined business operations and provided a more accurate view of sales trends, enhancing strategic planning.
